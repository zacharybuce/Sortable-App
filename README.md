# Sortable

## How to run
1. clone repo
2. cd into SnapshotMVP
3. run `npm install`
4. run `expo start` (a qr code should appear after is starts)
5. download the expo go app on your phone
6. take a picture of the qr code on the console

## What to do when you see errors
Apps can be finicky so if it stops working close the app and re launch it from the expo go app.
